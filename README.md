# Recording-Code
This is the recording software used to make a data set of guitar samples

The recording file acts as the main function
The tab file generates a tab and prints it in a legible way

Files are stored as wav files in a new directory
wav_files_log.txt is a txt file that records the file names next to their transcriptions
